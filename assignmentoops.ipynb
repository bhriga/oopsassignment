    "1)what is abstraction in oops?explain with example\n",
    "\n",
    "answer:A key concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) is abstraction.\n",
    "It involves hiding an object's implementation details and only showing the user\n",
    "the information that is absolutely necessary\n",
    "\n",
    "example:Your car is a great example of abstraction. You can start a car by turning the key or pressing the start button.\n",
    "You don’t need to know how the engine is getting started, what all components your car has.\n",
    "The car internal implementation and complex logic is completely hidden from the user\n",
    "\n",
    "2)differentiate between abstraction and encapsulation.explain with example\n",
    "\n",
    "answer:\n",
    "ENCAPSULATION:\n",
    "1)encapsulation is the process or method to contain the information.\n",
    "2)encapsulation, problems are solved at the implementation level\n",
    "3)encapsulation is a method to hide the data in asingle entity or\n",
    "unit along with a method to protect information from outside\n",
    "4) encapsulation can be implemented using by access modifier i.e. private, protected and public.\n",
    "ABSTRACTION:\n",
    "1)Abstraction is the process or method of gaining the information\n",
    "2)In abstraction, problems are solved at the design or interface level\n",
    "3)Abstraction is the method of hiding the unwanted information\n",
    "4)We can implement abstraction using abstract class and interfaces.\n",
    "EXAMPLE:\n",
    " Abstraction is used in mobile phones’ GUI. When you click on the icons,\n",
    "abstraction allows them to perform specific functions.\n",
    "Let’s look at the encapsulation example to clarify the Encapsulation vs Abstraction. \n",
    "After the icon is clicked, the encapsulation works in the backend to guide the user on the next steps.\n",

    "3)What is abc module in python? Why is it used?\n",
    "\n",
    "answer:\n",
    "Python is not a fully object-oriented programming language but \n",
    "it supports the features like abstract classes and abstraction. \n",
    "We cannot create abstract classes directly in Python,\n",
    "so Python provides a module called abc that provides the \n",
    "infrastructure for defining the base of Abstract Base Classes(ABC).\n",
    " \n",
    " 4) How can we achieve data abstraction?\n",
    "\n",
    "answer:\n",
    "We can achieve data abstraction through Abstract classes and interfaces. \n",
    "Through abstract classes, you can achieve partial or complete abstraction \n",
    "as abstract classes contain methods that have an implementation which can \n",
    "result in partial abstraction\n",
    "\n",
    "5)Can we create an instance of an abstract class? Explain your answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "answer:\n",
    "No, you cannot create an instance of an abstract class.\n",
    "An abstract class is like a template or empty structure that\n",
    "doesn't have a complete implementation.\n",
    "If you try to create an instance of an abstract class, you will get a compile-time error\n",
    "\n",
